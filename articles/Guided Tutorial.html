<p>XcalRep (<strong>x</strong>-<strong>cal</strong>ibration &amp; <strong>rep</strong>roducibility) is an R implementation of methods used for cross-calibration and precision analysis of HR-pQCT It enables cross-calibration and precision analysis in R for single- and multi-centre studies, conducted at single or multiple timepoints. XcalRep was developed with intended use for HR-pQCT, however, it easily extends to other instruments which undergo routine calibration and reproducibility assessment. ## Terminology Throughout this vignette and accompanying paper (<strong>citation placeholder</strong>), we use the following terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Features</strong>: Data column variable, such as “value”, “site”, “timePoint” or “phantom”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feature type</strong>: A specific realization of a feature, sometimes referred to as type. E.g., “Toronto” and “Montreal” are two different feature types belonging to the “site” feature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>parameter</strong>: A specific type of HR-pQCT measurement, such as “Tb. vBMD” or “Tb. N”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>value</strong>: Parameter measurement obtained by HR-pQCT.</p></li>
</ul>

<a href="#expected-input-data" class="anchor"></a>1.3 Expected input data</h3>
<p>When initiating a Calibration Object, the following list of features below are expected:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>value</strong>: quantitative measure obtained by instrument.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>site</strong>: Instrument used to obtain measurement values. E.g., ‘Toronto’ refers to single HR-pQCT scanner located in Toronto.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>scanID</strong>: Non-unique identifier used to specify scanning set. E.g., triplciate phantom scans will have the same scanID.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>section</strong>: Region in phantom corresponding to unique characteristics. Recommended for precision analyses, and required for cross-calibrations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>timePoint</strong>: Time point at which measures were obtained (e.g., baseline, 6 months, 12 months). Numerical and character values accepted</p></li>
<li><p><strong>phantom</strong>: Type of imaging phantom used (e.g., EFP, QC1). Can also be specified as <em>in vivo</em> scanned region (e.g., radius, tibia), thus allowing for short-term precision analysis of <em>in vivo</em> scans (e.g., replicate patient scans with full repositioning).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>parameter</strong>: Specific type of instrument measurement. E.g., ‘Tt. vBMD’.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>scanDate</strong>: Date at which instrument measurements were obtained.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that expected input are spelling- and case-sensitive. Make sure everything is correctly specified!</p>

<p>In practice, not all datasets will have data for each expected feature. For example, a study may only be interested in quantifying the short-term precision of a single instrument. In such a case, the timePoint and site features can be omitted and the <code>Calibration Object</code> will issue a warning that the omitted feature was detected and a placeholder feature was created (this will not affect downstream analysis).</p>
<p>We can see how this is handled by XcalRep using an incomplete input dataset</p>

<div id="assays" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#assays" class="anchor"></a>2.1 Assays</h3>
<p>A central feature of <code>Calibration Objects</code> are <code>Assays</code>. When a <code>Calibration Object</code> is initiated, an <code>Assay</code> is automatically created and stored within the <code>Calibration Object</code>. <code>Assays</code> are organized data structures that contain the following slots:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>data</strong>: list of datasets (uncalibrated and/or calibrated)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>analysis</strong>: list of analyses performed on datasets (results from XcalRep functions with <em>Analysis</em> suffix are stored here)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>calibration</strong>: fitted curves used for cross calibration (see <em>fit.calibration()</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>plots</strong>: list of plots (results from XcalRep function with <em>plot</em> suffix are stored here)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>features</strong>: features available in datasets</p></li>
<li><p><strong>feature.types</strong>: list of features and their unique types</p></li>
<li><p><strong>N</strong>: list of unique feature types and their counts</p></li>
<li><p><strong>description</strong>: assay name</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice we may be interested in analyzing the same dataset using different analysis specifications. Rather than overwriting existing data, or handling multiple <code>Calibration Objects</code>, we can simply specify a new <code>Assay</code> within the same <code>Calibration Object</code>. Thus a <code>Calibration Object</code> can accomodate multiple assays, each representing a different version of the data and/or analysis.</p>
<p>When multiple assays exist, XcalRep analyses are performed on the current assay. We can check the current assay using the <code>getAssay</code>. Since we just created the <code>Calibration Object</code>, our data is stored in an “input” <code>assay</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="co"># get current assay</span>
<span class="fu"><a href="../reference/getAssay.html">getAssay</a></span>(<span class="no">co</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>#&gt; [1] "input"</code></pre>
<p>Each dataset within an <code>Assay</code> is designated either “uncalibrated” or “calibrated”. The “calibrated” designation is set only after performing data calibration (<em>discussed in Section 5</em>). For now, input data is by default designated “uncalibrated”. We can check the calibration status of datasets in an assay using <code>getDatasets</code>.</p>

<p>The first step of any calibration or precision analysis begins with preprocessing the data.</p>
<p>First we specify which feature types we want to include in our analysis using <code>analyzeWhich</code>. If inclusion or omission criteria for a given feature are not specified, all feature types are included.</p>
<p>Since our data contains a single phantom (<em>See Section 2</em>), we will only analyze <em>sections 2-4</em>, and include measurements for parameters <em>“Tb. vBMD”</em>, <em>“Tt. vBMD”</em>, <em>“Tb. BVTV”</em>, <em>“ct. vBMD (XCTII)”</em>, and <em>“Ct. Th. (XCTII)”</em>. Sometimes it may be faster to omit undesired feature types instead of listing all types to include. This can be accomplished using an omission argument, as demonstrated for <em>“Tb. BVTV”</em> in this example.</p>

<p>Once we have our list of features <code>analyze.these</code> to analyze (<em>Section 3.1</em>), we can preprocess our dataset. This will create a new <code>Assay</code> within our <code>Calibration Object</code>, taking the current <code>Assay</code> (i.e., “input”) and filtering it to only include the subset of features that we are interested in for downstream analysis.

<a href="#single-variant-precision-analyses" class="anchor"></a>4. Single-Variant Precision Analyses</h2>
<p><strong>Single-variant precision (SVP) analyses</strong> aim to calculate the inherent variability of an instrument, without consideration for time- or scanner-dependent sources of error. That is, precision estimates are calculated by first computing replicate-level statistics (e.g., triplicate phantom scans at a single time point by a single scanner), and then pooled across all scanners and time points to yield a root-mean-square precision estimate. This is commonly known as a <strong>short-term single-scanner/site precision</strong> estimate and conveys meaning about how precision a given technology is at a given point in time, without consideration for external factors, such as drift over time, or between-scanner discrepancies.</p>

<p>Outliers are automatically flagged during SVP analysis and two sets of rms statistics tables are generated; <code>rms.statistics</code> contains statistics computed using all data, and <code>rms.statistics.no.outliers</code> contains results where outliers were omitted. Additionally, the <code>replicate.statistics</code> table contains an <code>outlier.flag</code> feature which flags suspected outliers. While it is generally poor practice to omit outiers from precision analyses, in the context of a multi-centre trial it may be informative to identify outlying sites. If outliers appear randomly distributed throughout the dataset and there is not discernable bias (e.g., all outlying data comes from a single site), it is recommended to retain all data for downstream analysis. If outlier prevalence is biased towards a certain site, users should investigate the source of error further.</p>
<p>The easiest way to appraise outliers is to examine the <code>replicate.statistics</code> interactive datatable and sort entries using <code>outlier.flag</code>.</p>

The <code>showTable</code> function provides users with an easy way to generate tables as interactive data tables (as seen above) or as data frames. Interactive data tables allow users to export results directy into their clipboard or to csv or excel, and enable easy data filtering, sorting and exploration in the R Studio Enviroment.

<p>To visualize <code>svpAnalysis</code> results, use the <code>svpPlot</code> function. The default output plots CV-based precision errors, however STD-based precision errors can also be plotted using the <code>var2plot</code> argument. In this example we omit outliers and stratify the data by HR-pQCT scanner to determine whether 2nd generation XtremeCT scanners (XCT2) are more precise than 1st generation scanners (XCT1).</p>
<p>Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test is also performed (using <code>group.by</code> feature for data stratification) and p-values are shown for each comparison group. Significant differences in precision errors are observed between XCT1 and XCT2 scanners.</p>
